How-to use JAX with ``qiskit-dynamics``
=======================================

JAX enables just-in-time compilation, automatic differentation, and GPU
execution. JAX is integrated into ``qiskit-dynamics`` via the
``Array`` class, which allows most parts of the package to be
executed with either ``numpy`` or ``jax.numpy``.

This guide addresses the following topics:

1. How do I configure dynamics to run with JAX?
2. How do I write code using dispatch that can be executed with either
   ``numpy`` or JAX?
3. How do I write JAX-transformable functions using the objects and
   functions in ``qiskit-dynamics``?
4. Gotchas when using JAX with dynamics.

1. How do I configure dynamics to run with JAX?
-----------------------------------------------

The ``Array`` class provides a means of controlling whether array
operations are performed using ``numpy`` or ``jax.numpy``. In many
cases, the “default backend” is used to determine which of the two
options is used.

.. jupyter-execute::

    # configure jax to use 64 bit mode
    import jax
    jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

    # tell JAX we are using CPU
    jax.config.update('jax_platform_name', 'cpu')

    # import Array and set default backend
    from qiskit_dynamics.array import Array
    Array.set_default_backend('jax')

The default backend can be observed via:

.. jupyter-execute::

    Array.default_backend()


2. How do I write code using Array that can be executed with either ``numpy`` or JAX?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``Array`` class wraps both ``numpy`` and ``jax.numpy``
arrays. The particular type is indicated by the ``backend`` property,
and ``numpy`` functions called on an ``Array`` will automatically be
dispatched to ``numpy`` or ``jax.numpy`` based on the ``Array``\ ’s
backend. See the API documentation for ``qiskit_dynamics.array`` for
details.

3. How do I write JAX-transformable functions using the objects and functions in ``qiskit-dynamics``?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAX-transformable functions must be:

  - JAX-executable.
  - Take JAX arrays as input and output (see the
    `JAX documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
    for more details on accepted input and output types).
  - Pure, in the sense that they have no side-effects.

The previous section shows how to handle the first two points using
``Array``. The last point further restricts the type of
code that can be safely transformed. Qiskit Dynamics uses various objects which
can be updated by setting properties (models, solvers). If a function to
be transformed requires updating an already-constructed object of this
form, it is necessary to first make a *copy*.

We demonstrate this process for both just-in-time compilation and
automatic differentiation in the context of an anticipated common
use-case: parameterized simulation of a model of a quantum system.

3.1 Just-in-time compiling a parameterized simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Just-in-time compiling" a function means to compile it at run time. Just-in-time compilation
incurs an initial cost associated with the construction of the compiled function,
but subsequent calls to the function will generally be faster than the uncompiled version.
In JAX, just-in-time compilation is performed using the ``jax.jit`` function,
which transforms a JAX-compatible function into optimized code using
`XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla>`__. We demonstrate here how, using the JAX backend,
functions built using Qiskit Dynamics can be
just-in-time compiled, resulting in faster simulation times.

For convenience, the ``wrap`` function can be used to transform
``jax.jit`` to also work on functions that have ``Array`` objects as
inputs and outputs.

.. jupyter-execute::
    
    from qiskit_dynamics.array import wrap

    jit = wrap(jax.jit, decorator=True)

Construct a ``Solver`` instance with a model that will be used to solve.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator
    from qiskit_dynamics import Solver, Signal
    from qiskit_dynamics.array import Array

    r = 0.5
    w = 1.
    X = Operator.from_label('X')
    Z = Operator.from_label('Z')

    static_hamiltonian = 2 * np.pi * w * Z/2
    hamiltonian_operators = [2 * np.pi * r * X/2]

    solver = Solver(
        static_hamiltonian=static_hamiltonian,
        hamiltonian_operators=hamiltonian_operators,
        rotating_frame=static_hamiltonian
    )


Next, define the function to be compiled:

  - The input is the amplitude of a constant-envelope signal on resonance, driven over time
    :math:`[0, 3]`.
  - The output is the state of the system, starting in the ground state, at
    ``100`` points over the total evolution time.

Note, as described at the beginning of this section, we need to make a copy of ``solver``
before setting the signals, to ensure the simulation function remains pure.

.. jupyter-execute::

    def sim_function(amp):

        # define a constant signal
        amp = Array(amp)
        signals = [Signal(amp, carrier_freq=w)]

        # make copy and set signals
        solver_copy = solver.copy()
        solver.signals = signals

        # simulate and return results
        # setting user_frame tells solve that states should be specified and returned in the frame
        # of the drift
        results = solver_copy.solve(
            t_span=[0, 3.],
            t_eval=np.linspace(0, 3., 100),
            y0=np.array([0., 1.], dtype=complex),
            method='jax_odeint'
        )

        return results.y

Compile the function.

.. jupyter-execute::

    fast_sim = jit(sim_function)

The first time the function is called, JAX will compile an
`XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla>`__ version of the function, which is then executed.
Hence, the time taken on the first call *includes* compilation time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time ys = fast_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


On subsequent calls the compiled function is directly executed,
demonstrating the true speed of the compiled function.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %timeit fast_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


We use this function to plot the :math:`Z` expectation value over a
range of input amplitudes.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    for amp in np.linspace(0, 1, 10):
        ys = fast_sim(amp)
        plt.plot(np.linspace(0, 3., 100), np.real(np.abs(ys[:, 0])**2-np.abs(ys[:, 1])**2))


3.2 Automatically differentiating a parameterized simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we use ``jax.grad`` to automatically differentiate a parameterized
simulation. In this case, ``jax.grad`` requires that the output be a
real number, so we specifically compute the population in the excited
state at the end of the previous simulation

.. jupyter-execute::

    def excited_state_pop(amp):
        yf = sim_function(amp)[-1]
        return np.abs(Array(yf[0]))**2

Wrap ``jax.grad`` in the same way, then differentiate and compile
``excited_state_pop``.

.. jupyter-execute::

    grad = wrap(jax.grad, decorator=True)

    excited_pop_grad = jit(grad(excited_state_pop))

As before, the first execution includes compilation time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time excited_pop_grad(1.).block_until_ready()


Subsequent runs of the function reveal the execution time once compiled.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %timeit excited_pop_grad(1.).block_until_ready()


4. Pitfalls when using JAX with Dynamics
----------------------------------------

4.1 JAX must be set as the default backend before building any objects in Qiskit Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get dynamics to run with JAX, it is necessary to configure dynamics
to run with JAX *before* building any objects or running any functions.
The internal behaviour of some objects is modified by what the default
backend is *at the time of instantiation*. For example, at instantiation
the operators in a model or ``Solver`` instance will be wrapped in an
``Array`` whose backend is the current default backend, and changing the
default backend after building the object won’t change this.

4.2 Running Dynamics with JAX on CPU vs GPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain JAX-based features in Dynamics are primarily recommended for use only with CPU
or only with GPU. In such cases, a warning is raised if non-recommended hardware is used,
however users are not prevented from configuring Dynamics and JAX in whatever way they choose.

Instances of such features are:
  * Setting ``evaluation_mode='sparse'`` for solvers and models is only recommended for use on CPU.
  * Parallel fixed step solver options in ``solve_lmde`` are recommended only for use on GPU.
